I had fun learning about the basic sorting algorithms, which is why I implemented them in Java using some OOP - to see how fast each algorithm is and how many comparisons there are.
Here you will find the following sorting algorithms:
- Selectionsort (real & custom one)
- Bubblesort (old & new version)
- Insertsort
- Quicksort (multiple & single list version)
